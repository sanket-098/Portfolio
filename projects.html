      <h2>Vehicle Accident Alert System </h2>
      <p class="muted">Mentor: Prof. Vaishali Katkar | Team Size: 4</p>
      <p>Designed and developed an intelligent accident detection and alert system using Arduino Nano, ADXL345 accelerometer, GPS (NEO6M), and GSM
         (SIM800L) modules to automatically detect collisions and send real-time location alerts to emergency contacts.
         Integrated Wi-Fi (ESP8266) for contact management and manual emergency/cancel buttons to prevent false alarms. The system
         ensures faster emergency response by providing instant accident notifications with GPS coordinates, enhancing passenger safety in
         vehicles. Focused on cost-effective design, real-time communication, and reliability, with successful testing of impact sensitivity, location
         accuracy, and transmission speed.</p>

      <h2>Intelligent Vehicle Detection & Alert System for Hilly Areas</h2>
      <p class="muted">Mentor: Dr. Kalpana Pawase | Team Size: 4</p>
      <p>This invention is related to the field of automated road safety systems, particularly in hilly
         and accident-prone terrains, using sensor-based detection and signaling mechanisms. More
         specifically, it is a system to detect approaching vehicles and alert other road users via visual
         and audio signals to prevent accidents.</p>

    <h2>Smart Bluetooth-Controlled Door Lock System</h2>
    <p class="muted">Mentor: Dr. Aswathy M A | Team Size: 4</p>
    <p>Developed a secure Bluetooth-based smart door lock using Arduino Uno, HC-05,
       and a solenoid lock. Implemented wireless lock/unlock control via mobile app
       with proper driver circuitry, diode protection, and dedicated solenoid power.
       Strengthened skills in embedded programming, Bluetooth communication, and hardware
       software integration.</p>
